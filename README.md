# Sociality.io FrontendProject
I have written and developed this project to apply for a job posting as a Junior Frontend Developer in Sociality.io.

Technologies used:
HTML/CSS/JavaScript with React.js and Context API.

How to start project:
1. Open socialityproject directory: ```cd socialityproject```.
2. Run this command in the terminal: ```npm start```.

Bonus:
I have made the design responsive in all screen kinds (mobile, tablet, pc), and the posts were sorted (descending) according to their date.
